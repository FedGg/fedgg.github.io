The Five Cardinal Relations, or *Wu Lun* (五倫)[^1], are a philosophical framework underpinning Chinese culture and social structure for over two millennia. The concept is attributed to *Mencius* (*Mengzi*)[^2], a philosopher, teacher, social and political theorist considered the spiritual successor of Confucius (Kongzi). For Mencius a human is not a static being, but a dynamic *becoming*, striving toward *sagehood*. An infant is not born as an ‘‘individual,’’ but rather, born into a framework of familial and socio-cultural relations that would shape and nurture that infant’s *benxing* (original human nature). 

The self-cultivation of the four virtues defining one's *benxing* is a lifelong process of deepening one’s familial and social relationships to their fullest potential. The Five Relations are *parent-child, ruler-minister, husband-wife, old-young, and friend-friend.* The idea implies a relational, rather than an essential understanding of personhood, considering the progressive maturing of human nature within a matrix of reciprocal relations that, over a lifetime, define one’s identity.
