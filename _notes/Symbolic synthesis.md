In simple terms I would define symbolic synthesis is the way we represent complex ideas or stories using brief and simple verbal and visual metaphors. 

In general terms "Symbolic synthesis" refers to the process of integrating and combining various symbolic representations (such as language, images, or concepts) to create new meanings, understandings, or knowledge structures. This process involves the analysis, interpretation, and fusion of different symbolic elements to generate a cohesive and often more complex symbolic representation.

I meant to say simpler! But simpler does not necessarily mean less complex. Think of the droplet in Three Body Problem...
