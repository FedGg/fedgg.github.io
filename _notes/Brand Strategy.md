A brand [[AllNotes/Strategy|strategy]] is a set of interconnected principles to coordinate actions in an organisation in such a way that its customers and stakeholders build meaning and brand equity over time.

The process of creating or revising a brand strategy [[Brands start and end with people|starts and ends with people]], and generally results in a [[Brand Strategy Framework]] where the core principles are captured and connected.
