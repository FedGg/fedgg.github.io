[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], defined **Flow** as a state of "optimal experience." It is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in an activity, characterised by a feeling of energised focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

In *Flow*, he describes it as:

> _"The state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it."_ [^1]
