Those of us following unorthodox, non-linear professional development pathways, might have developed into what philosopher Jonathan Rawson calls *expert generalists*. This concept describes someone who develops deep knowledge in one specific area and then uses that expertise as a foundation to make connections across other domains. This approach allows for a more holistic understanding of complex issues and an improved ability to navigate uncertainty.

> The idea of an expert generalist is paradoxical but not oxymoronic. In theory, our very best philosophers, civil servants, political leaders, and writers are expert generalists — their defining skill is inclusive synthesis and their defining qualities are epistemic acumen and agility: know-how with knowledge, having enough expertise in one domain to value different forms of understanding, and knowing how to integrate them while retaining curiosity towards whatever which remains unfamiliar.[^1]

Communication design, in the broader sense [[Design is multidisciplinary|articulated by Pieraccini]], also requires epistemic acumen and agility, (the ability to adapt and learn across disciplines) and crucially a capacity for inclusive synthesis, whether through words or symbols.
