When you meet someone new, the standard question is: «What do you do?». I find it hard to give a coherent answer. Mainly because what I do, depends. The way I think about it also changes. My answer may be either bland and generic («designer», «[[strategist]]», «consultant») or too long.

As a result of my work history I developed some expertise in building brands. At times I said: I am a [[brand]] builder. I work with people to develop brands holistically. 

But why do we reply  «I _am_…» in response to the question «What do you _do_?». We are not only defined by what we do for a living. Not all doctors, firemen, artists or brand consultants are the same. Based on this insight, my fabulous friend and compatriot Simona Barbieri built an incredible community (and business). You don’t ask people what they do in a [Hub Dot](https://hubdot.com/) event. You ask them to tell their stories.

So, to begin understanding who we are, we shall meet: you’ll tell me your story, and I'll tell you mine. Interestingly that meeting would change who I am, and who you are, to the extent it will change our respective stories. We seem to believe that we exist as individuals, but deeper enquiry reveals that [[We exist in a complex web of ever changing relations]]. With the other beings we meet, our environment, and everything else.
