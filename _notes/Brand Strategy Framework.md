## Brand Strategy Framework — definitions

For convenience, to share a common vocabulary with collaborators and clients, I compiled a set of definitions of frequently used terms used in brand strategy. My aim is to eliminate redundancies, clarify relationships between components, and align more closely with academic language while maintaining a practical orientation needed for implementation.

### Brand Foundation Elements

Applicable to company / organisation brands.

**Purpose**: The fundamental reason the organisation exists beyond profit; its contribution to society and people's lives. 'People' include (but is not limited to) customers and employees.

**Vision**: The aspirational future state the brand seeks to create or achieve. 

**Mission**: The operational description of how the brand fulfils its purpose day-to-day.

**Values**: The core beliefs and principles that guide organisational behaviours and decision-making.

Additional variations, similar to vision and purpose

**Strategic Aspiration**: The ambitious, future-oriented goal that stretches the organisation beyond its current capabilities and provides direction for strategic choices.

**North Star**: The singular, customer-centric outcome that defines success for the organisation and guides all development decisions and priorities.

### Market Context Elements

Also applicable to product and service brands

**Cultural Insights**: Broader social patterns, trends, and value systems that influence how the brand is interpreted and experienced.

**Target Audience**: The specific customer or audience segments the brand primarily aims to serve.

**Audience Insights**: Deep understanding of the target audience needs, motivations, behaviours, and decision journeys relative to the category. 

**Strategic Capabilities**: The distinctive organisational resources, competencies, and assets that give the brand its "right to win" in the marketplace and enable it to deliver on its value proposition.

**Competitive Landscape**: Analysis of where the brand sits relative to competitors and alternative solutions. (see Differentiation)

### Brand Positioning Elements

**The Enemy or Problem**: The problem the brand aims to solve for customers. The cultural or market tension that inspires its actions.

**Brand Positioning**: The distinctive place the brand occupies in customers' minds relative to alternatives.

**Value Proposition**: The collection of functional benefits (what the brand does), emotional benefits (how it makes people feel), and self-expressive benefits (what it says about them) that together create value for customers/audiences.

**Differentiation**: The specific benefits, attributes, or associations that meaningfully distinguish the brand from competitors in people's minds.

**Reasons to Believe**: The tangible evidence and proof points that support the brand's claims.

### Brand Expression Elements

**Brand Personality**: The human characteristics and traits associated with the brand. How people in the organisation would like other people to perceive the brand.

**Tone of Voice**: The distinctive verbal expression of the brand, including language, tone of voice and communication style.

**Brand Essence**: The distillation of the brand's core identity into a few defining words or a short phrase.

**Brand Experience Principles**: Guidelines for how the brand comes to life and 'behaves' across touchpoints. 

**Visual Identity**: The comprehensive system of visual elements—including logo, typography, colour palette, imagery style, and design principles—that consistently expresses the brand's personality and positioning across all touch-points.
