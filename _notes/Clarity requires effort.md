In my job, I strive for clarity and simplicity This is what [[brand strategy]] needs to do. Bring clarity, focus, alignment. It's not magic or flamboyant rhetoric. It's finding the truth from people and mirroring it back to them without all the noise. It's cleaning the mirror of mirages. Removing any distorting lens.

Often it is really a matter of listening (without any distorting lens), understanding (while keeping in mind multiple perspectives), and getting to the bottom of what is being discussed (to the essence of what matters). The synthesis, if one can be achieved, appears almost self-evident, possibly underwhelming in its simplicity. Did I really need all of those conversations and elaborations to arrive to something that simple and rather obvious? Well, yes.
