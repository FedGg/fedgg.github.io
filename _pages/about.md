## About these notes

I write to help me think. These notes are the building blocks for ideas I am researching, developing and writing about. I am publishing them here as an experiment of '[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ)'.

I publish finished articles and a newsletter: <a href="https://ideas.gaggio.com/" style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">Ideas Garden</a>

Please contact me [here](https://linktr.ee/fedg/) if you any comments, questions or suggestions.
